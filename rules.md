# Goblin Quest

## IDEA
Each player plays a clan of goblins. 
Goal is to die heroically while completing your quest.

Goblins have a Quest. A thing they are trying to do. Broken up into stages with objectives they need to accomplish. Objectives have difficulty levels that goblins can reduce by rolling a 5-6.

Each clan has a ...
1. ... last name
1. ... unique defining feature / lineage / look (big eyes, blue hair, impressively stupid)
1. ... heirloom (Item passed from gobo to gobo important to the clan)

## RULES
### Goblins
Goblins have 2 HP, a special skill and a weapon.
Goblins can call upon things when acting. Each thing adds a d6 to the thrown dice.
Only applicable if fitting to situation.
- special skill +1d6 (each gobo has a special skill) 
- useful weapon +1d6 (each gobo has a weapon)
- use heirloom +1d6
- doing a thing +1d6 (always applies)
Dice are not summed up, each d6 rolled lead to a result.

### Dice results:
- 1-2: you get injured
- 3: something bad happens (next gobo gets -1)
- 4: something good happens (next gobo gets +1)
- 5-6: great success (subtract one difficulty point from the objective)
